# Project- 1

#   Abstract:
The aim of this project is to assist healthcare professionals in detecting liver disease in patients. To achieve this, we utilize ensemble learning methods, specifically employing decision trees as base learners to enhance both performance and efficiency. Our goal is to predict liver disease at an earlier stage, facilitating timely intervention. While some common types of liver diseases can be managed through lifestyle and dietary changes, others may require lifelong medication. Ultimately, this project seeks to develop a machine learning application that accurately detects liver disease using boosting ensemble learning techniques.

# Model used:
XGBoost using Decision trees as base learners

# Metrics:
Accuracy,
Precision, Classification report, roc_auc curve, confusion matrix
